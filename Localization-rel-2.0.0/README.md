Localization abstractions and implementations for ASP.NET Core applications.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

### Samples

Here are a few samples that demonstrate different localization features including: localized views, localized strings in data annotations, creating custom localization resources ... etc.

 * [Localization.StarterWeb](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/dev/samples/Localization.StarterWeb) - comprehensive localization sample demonstrates almost all of the localization features
 * [Localization.EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/dev/samples/Localization.EntityFramework) - localization sample that uses an EntityFramework based localization provider for resources
 * [Localization.CustomResourceManager](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/dev/samples/Localization.CustomResourceManager) - localization sample that uses a custom `ResourceManagerStringLocalizer`
